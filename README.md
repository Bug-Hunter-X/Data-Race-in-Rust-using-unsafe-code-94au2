This repository contains a simple Rust program that demonstrates a data race using unsafe code.  The program creates a vector, obtains a mutable pointer to its data, and then modifies the data using unsafe code. This is unsafe because another thread might deallocate or resize the vector, leading to undefined behavior. The solution demonstrates how to avoid this issue by using safe Rust features.
